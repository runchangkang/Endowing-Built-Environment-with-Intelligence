# Endowing-Built-Environment-with-Intelligence
As we inhabit in a world in which the line between the physical and the digital is gradually blurred, the vision of architecture with computational techniques are actively participating in our lives. Because of the rapid developments in computation, cybernetics, artificial intelligence, and engineering, architectural environment increasingly becomes receptive, perceptive, reactive, interactive, and even proactive. However, although people are fascinated with the idea of these reactive spaces and the ubiquitous computing, there is still missing an integrated sensing system which not only leverages the occupants’ status, activities, interactions, and contextual information but also maintaining extensibility and expandability. Moreover, it still requires great efforts, especially for non-experts, to design appliances and applications compatible with the system.  In this thesis, I present a lightweight sensing system which can gather, analyze and fuse the occupants’ movement, gestures and voice data, provide easy-to-use templates and rules for designers and developers to create appliance and the configure the behavior of the application. I provide the audiences with a design space which articulates the potency of the system being applied in two major domains - smart home context and creativity installation context. Moreover, the system and the hardware is detailed packaged and documented and serves as an off-the-shelf open sourced project for eliciting future contributions.
